# alura_challenge_front-end
As part of my studies in front-end development, i'm participating of Alura Challenge Front-End Edition.
This projet simulates a real environment of development. Where the members as developers receive a briefing and a prototype design, so work on it.
What is interesting is that we don't have all information need like we were working in a ideal projet.
Some information was hidden or was not specified. Thus we need to reach it to reach it in the internet when it is possible or to call the instructors to answer specific question like product owners.
